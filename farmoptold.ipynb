    "\n",
    "Our goal was to attempt to model the decisions facing a farmer when choosing what to grow on a hobby farm.  Given a plot of land, the farmer needs to choose which crops to grow, which livestock to raise and which equipment to purchase.  Unlike large-scale commercial farms, hobby farms tend to grow a diverse mixture of crops and livestock.  There is evidence that hobby farms fail more quickly than other types of agriculture[1], for many reasons but financial difficulties appear to be the primary driver.  Optimizing the profitability of such an endeavor, while also considering the constraint of diverisity in attempt to achieve a more \"idyllic\" setting, increases the likelihood of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of this optimization problem is higher than it may seem at first glance.  On a large scale monocultural farm the problem is relatively simple, which crop has the maximum profit per acre?  On a hobby farm with a goal of diversity this is not the case.  Often, a decision about one crop or livestock is affected by another.  For example, if a farmer decides to grow a crop which can be used as feed for their animals they decrease the possible profit from that crop while also decreasing costs associated with that livestock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding data with which to model this problem is not difficult.  In fact, the challenge is actually in sifting through the abundance of government and industry reports in order to track down the various values.  As our goal was attempting to create an accurate model of this problem, continuing to add more detail to bring it closer and closer to reality, government sources were identified and values for costs and returns pulled from their tables [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10].  If the focus of the work had been on searching for a true optimal set of choices and maximized return these data sources would have been further validated and the values normalized to ensure cross-compatibility (e.g dates, locations, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section will describe the iterative process used to model this problem.  Starting with a simplied \"toy\" model and then adding complexity in order to bring the model closer to the real world problem.  The model description is followed by [Julia] code using [JuMP] (Julia for Mathematical Optimization) in order to encode the model and find optimal results.  These results are then thoroughly described, with the final model being compared to previous, simplied iterations.  Finally, conclusions about the problem, model and process are presented.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 v1: Toy Model ###\n",
    "\n",
    "We used an iterative process to produce the model for our problem.  To begin we created a \"toy\" LP of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "  \\underset{x \\in \\mathbb{R^n}}{\\text{maximize}}\\qquad& cx \\\\\n",
    "    \\text{subject to:}\\qquad& Ax \\le b\\\\\n",
    "    \\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Such that $b$ is a vector of the parameters money, acres and housing available which define the specific instance of the problem.  $A$ is a matrix of monetary and space requirements for each crop/livestock choice.  And finally $c$ is a vector of profit values.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{\\pmatrix{a_{1,1}  & \\dots & a_{1,n+m} \\cr a_{2,1} & \\dots & a_{2,n+m}\\cr a_{3,1} & \\dots  & a_{3,n+m}\\cr}\\atop \\underset{(3 \\times(n+m))}{A}}\n",
    "{\\pmatrix{crop_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ crop_n \\\\ livestock_1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ livestock_m}\\atop  \\underset{((n+m) \\times 1)}{x}}\n",
    "\\raise12pt\\hbox{$\\leq$} {\\pmatrix{acres\\\\ housing\\\\ money}\\atop \\underset{(3 \\times 1)}{b}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "Creating this toy model allowed us to code the problem without complex constraints in order to ensure that data import and indexing was working properly.  The issue with this model is that it is an oversimplification of the problem and will only choose the single highest return crop and livestock for available acreage and housing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 v2: Adding Diversity Constraint, now MIP ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding detail, and complexity, to our model will bring it more in line with reality.  Adding a diversity constraint, i.e. forcing the optimum solution to include a minimum number of crop choices as well as a minimum number of livestock choices, changes our Linear Program into a mixed integer program.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to model this constraint indicator variables were added, $y_i$ and $z_i$ which indicate whether or not a certain crop or livestock is included in the optimal choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ crop_i \\  > 0 \\Longrightarrow y_i = 1$$\n",
    "$$ livestock_i \\  > 0 \\Longrightarrow z_i = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As these are conditional statements they need to be converted to algebraic constraints.  This is done with the addition of a value $M$ which is the upper bound on an optimal solution.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$crop_i \\leq My_i $$\n",
    "$$livestock_i \\leq Nz_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of crop decisions the upper bound was set to the input parameter for available fields, in the case of livestock decisions the upper bound was set to the input parameter for available money.  These new constraints ensure that the indicator variables are valid.  Additional constraints can then be added to enforce the diversity constraint using the indicator variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_i y_i = \\text{number of desired crops}$$\n",
    "$$ \\sum_i z_i = \\text{number of desired livestock}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 v3: Adding Balance ###\n",
    "\n",
    "In version 3 it was decided to add a balance constraint, or a lower bound for chosen items.  This was done to ensure a non-trivial amount was chosen for each crop or livestock included in the optimal choice.  In order to model this additional parameters were added.  Separate lower bounds, one for the minimum area in which to plant a chosen crop, $lb_{crops}$, and the other for the minimum number of animals for each chosen livestock species, $lb_{lstock}$.  These bounds are then enforced conditionally.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_i > 0 \\Longrightarrow x_i \\geq \\text{lower bound}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As indicator variables were already implemented in version 2 they can be used in order to implement additional constraints which enforce these lower bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ crop_i \\geq y_i \\cdot lb_{crops}$$\n",
    "$$ livestock_i \\geq z_i \\cdot lb_{lstock}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 v4: Fixed Costs ###\n",
    "\n",
    "In version 4 fixed costs for raising crops were added.  The goal of these constraints is to model expenses which are fixed in relation to the indicator variables for the crops rather than variable with the amount grown.  This can be thought of as modeling the cost to rent the tractor and equipment necessary to plant, raise and harvest a crop.  A cost that is the same whether growing 1 acre or 1000 acres of the crop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, indicator variable are used to implement additional constraints which enforce these fixed costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$   \\begin{equation}\n",
    "    Cost_{crop_i}=\n",
    "    \\begin{cases}\n",
    "      0 & x_i=0 \\\\\n",
    "      fixed cost_{crop_i} + cost_{crop_i}\\cdot x_i & x_i > 0\n",
    "    \\end{cases}\n",
    "  \\end{equation} $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "### 2.5 v5: Internal Feed Savings ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 5 attempts to model the savings incurred by growing crops which can be used to feed the animals raised.  This models the assumption that a farmer will always be required to pay more for feedcrops than he would be able to sell them for.  A new indicator variable $w_i$ is added in order to model this mechanism.  This mechanism is used to indicate whether or not enough of a crop was grown to completely satisfy the internal feed requirements for that crop.  Utilizing our slide of trix this is a combination of conditionals.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ w_i = 1 \\iff \\sum_{j \\in livestock} feedrequirement_{i,j} \\cdot livestock_j \\leq feedcrop_i \\cdot return_i$$\n",

    "$$  \\epsilon(1-w_i)+m_i\\cdot w_i\\leq \\sum_{j \\in livestock} feedrequirement_{i,j} \\cdot livestock_j - feedcrop_i \\cdot return_i \\leq M(1-w_i)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This upper bound was set to the available money.  The lower bound is:\n",

    "## 5. Conclusion ##\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was a valuable exercise in understanding various LP and MIP models.  Adjustment of parameters permitted greater insight into the sensitivity of the model.  The parameter adjustment proved to be crucial in order to bring the model in line with our concept of what the real world results would look like.  In a real-world scenario the input parameters representing available resources would be fixed, so the sensitivity to parameter adjustmets would be restricted to diversity and balance choices. In addtion, in order to derive realistic insight from the results of the models a great effort in data validation and normalization would be required, well beyond the scope of this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting insight gained through the exercise is the connection between building out the code which defines the model and the resulting impact on the model itself.  While the code can be thought of as growing the model itself can be thought of as shrinking to better fit the true reality.  Each additional constraint grows the codebase, but most will shrink the feasible space.\n",
    "\n",
    "A future direction to pursue in enhancing the model could be to include an attempt at predictive returns based upon past market data.  Again, this would require great effort in data collection and validation, but the end goal would be a model which utilizes historical year-to-year data in order to predict which crops and livestock will provide the greatest returns in the upcoming year."
