    "Our goal was to attempt to model the decisions facing a farmer when choosing what to grow on a hobby farm.  Given a plot of land, the farmer needs to choose which crops to grow, which livestock to raise and which equipment to purchase.  Unlike large-scale commercial farms, hobby farms tend to grow a diverse mixture of crops and livestock.  There is evidence that hobby farms fail more quickly than other types of agriculture[1], for many reasons but financial difficulties appear to be the primary driver.  Optimizing the profitability of such an endeavor, while also considering the constraint of diverisity in attempt to achieve a more \"idyllic\" setting, increases the likelihood of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of this optimization problem is higher than it may seem at first glance.  On a large scale monocultural farm the problem is relatively simple, which crop has the maximum profit per acre?  On a hobby farm with a goal of diversity this is not the case.  Often, a decision about one crop or livestock is affected by another.  For example, if a farmer decides to grow a crop which can be used as feed for their animals they decrease the possible profit from that crop while also decreasing costs associated with that livestock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding data with which to model this problem is not difficult.  In fact, the challenge is actually in sifting through the abundance of government and industry reports in order to track down the various values.  As our goal was attempting to create an accurate model of this problem, continuing to add more detail to bring it closer and closer to reality, government sources were identified and values for costs and returns pulled from their tables [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10].  If the focus of the work had been on searching for a true optimal set of choices and maximized return these data sources would have been further validated and the values normalized to ensure cross-compatibility (e.g dates, locations, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section will describe the iterative process used to model this problem.  Starting with a simplied \"toy\" model and then adding complexity in order to bring the model closer to the real world problem.  The model description is followed by [Julia] code using [JuMP] (Julia for Mathematical Optimization) in order to encode the model and find optimal results.  These results are then thoroughly described, with the final model being compared to previous, simplied iterations.  Finally, conclusions about the problem, model and process are presented.\n",

    "Creating this toy model allowed us to code the problem without complex constraints in order to ensure that data import and indexing was working properly.  The issue with this model is that it is an oversimplification of the problem and will only choose the single highest return crop and livestock for available acreage and housing.\n",

    "### 2.2 v2: Adding Diversity Constraint, now MIP ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding detail, and complexity, to our model will bring it more in line with reality.  Adding a diversity constraint, i.e. forcing the optimum solution to include a minimum number of crop choices as well as a minimum number of livestock choices, changes our Linear Program into a mixed integer program.\n",

    "$$livestock_i \\leq Nz_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of crop decisions the upper bound was set to the input parameter for available fields, in the case of livestock decisions the upper bound was set to the input parameter for available money.  These new constraints ensure that the indicator variables are valid.  Additional constraints can then be added to enforce the diversity constraint using the indicator variables.  \n",

    "### 2.3 v3: Adding Balance ###\n",
    "\n",
    "In version 3 it was decided to add a balance constraint, or a lower bound for chosen items.  This was done to ensure a non-trivial amount was chosen for each crop or livestock included in the optimal choice.  In order to model this additional parameters were added.  Separate lower bounds, one for the minimum area in which to plant a chosen crop, $lb_{crops}$, and the other for the minimum number of animals for each chosen livestock species, $lb_{lstock}$.  These bounds are then enforced conditionally.\n",

In this case all acreage was planted with sunflowers and all housing utilized for broiler chickens.  This simple model, though, allowed us to manipulate input parameters in order to find changes in output and gain a better understanding of model sensitivity.\n",

    "Given the constraints and objective of the \"toy\" linear program there can only be one choice to utilize each input parameter unless multiple options have the same cost, return and requirements.  The stated objective of this projected is to attempt to model hobby farming decisions with the desired goal of a profitable and diverse small farm.  In order to force diverse choices in our model it was necessary to implement a minimum number of choices in both crops and livestock.  This, now MIP, model again produced expected results.  The optimal choices determined by the LP were maximized while satisfying the constraint by making additional choices but at such small numbers as to be effectively 0.\n",

    "Adding a requirement for a minimum number of choices was not enough to make the model select for a truly diverse set of crops and livestock.  This diversity constraint is not something easily codified into mathematical constraints and additional restrictions are necessary in order to bring the model inline with the subjective goal.  Lower bounds can force the model away from choosing to commit nearly 100% of the resources to the most profitable choices.  The strength of optimality of the choices by the original LP are still evident in the fact that suboptimal choices will be allocated resources exactly equal to the lower bound with all remaining allocated to the optimal choice.\n",

    "## 5. Conclusion ##\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was a valuable exercise in understanding various LP and MIP models.  Adjustment of parameters permitted greater insight into the sensitivity of the model.  In a real-world scenario the input parameters representing available resources would be fixed, so the sensitivity to parameter adjustmets would be restricted to diversity and balance choices. In addtion, in order to derive realistic insight from the results of the models a great effort in data validation and normalization would be required, well beyond the scope of this assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting insight gained through the exercise is the connection between building out the code which defines the model and the resulting impact on the model itself.  While the code can be thought of as growing the model itself can be thought of as shrinking to better fit the true reality.  Each additional constraint grows the codebase, but most will shrink the feasible space.\n",
    "\n",
    "A future direction to pursue in enhancing the model could be to include an attempt at predictive returns based upon past market data.  Again, this would require great effort in data collection and validation, but the end goal would be a model which utilizes historical year-to-year data in order to predict which crops and livestock will provide the greatest returns in the upcoming year."
