    "## 1. Introduction ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal was to attempt to model the decisions facing a farmer when choosing what to grow on a hobby farm.  Given a plot of land, the farmer needs to choose which crops to grow, which livestock to raise and which equipment to purchase.  Unlike large-scale commercial farms, hobby farms tend to grow a diverse mixture of crops and livestock.  There is evidence that hobby farms fail more quickly than other types of agriculture[1], for many reasons but financial difficulties appear to be the primary driver.  Optimizing the profitability of such an endeavor, while also considering the constraint of diverisity in attempt to achieve a more \"idyllic\" setting, increases the likelihood of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of this optimization problem is higher than it may seem at first glance.  On a large scale monocultural farm the problem is relatively simple, which crop has the maximum profit per acre?  On a hobby farm with a goal of diversity this is not the case.  Often, a decision about one crop or livestock is affected by another.  For example, if a farmer decides to grow a crop which can be used as feed for their animals they decrease the possible profit from that crop while also decreasing costs associated with that livestock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding data with which to model this problem is not difficult.  In fact, the challenge is actually in sifting through the abundance of government and industry reports in order to track down the various values.  As our goal was attempting to create an accurate model of this problem, continuing to add more detail to bring it closer and closer to reality, government sources were identified and values for costs and returns pulled from their tables [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10].  If the focus of the work had been on searching for a true optimal set of choices and maximized return these data sources would have been further validated and the values normalized to ensure cross-compatibility (e.g dates, locations, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section will describe the iterative process used to model this problem.  Starting with a simplied \"toy\" model and then adding complexity in order to bring the model closer to the real world problem.  The model description is followed by [Julia] code using [JuMP] (Julia for Mathematical Optimization) in order to encode the model and find optimal results.  These results are then thoroughly described, with the final model being compared to previous, simplied iterations.  Finally, conclusions about the problem, model and process are presented.\n",

    "As Joe see it, we should start with a description of the toy problem.  An LP which takes in the basic crop and livestock costs and returns and calculates the largest possible profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then add a \"diversity\" constraint from MIP which ensures that the farm does not produce only one thing.  Maybe setting a minimum of 4 choices?  Or no more than 25% to a certain output?  These are just ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we try to connect the ouput of crops to the inputs required by livestock (i.e. if we grow grain we might save money by feeding that to our animals rather than selling it).\n",

    "Adding detail, and complexity, to our model will bring it more in line with reality.
