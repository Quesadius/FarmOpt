    "## 1. Introduction ##\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal was to attempt to model the decisions facing a farmer when choosing what to grow on a hobby farm.  Given a plot of land, the farmer needs to choose which crops to grow, which livestock to raise and which equipment to purchase.  Unlike large-scale commercial farms, hobby farms tend to grow a diverse mixture of crops and livestock.  There is evidence that hobby farms fail more quickly than other types of agriculture[1], for many reasons but financial difficulties appear to be the primary driver.  Optimizing the profitability of such an endeavor, while also considering the constraint of diverisity in attempt to achieve a more \"idyllic\" setting, increases the likelihood of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complexity of this optimization problem is higher than it may seem at first glance.  On a large scale monocultural farm the problem is relatively simple, which crop has the maximum profit per acre?  On a hobby farm with a goal of diversity this is not the case.  Often, a decision about one crop or livestock is affected by another.  For example, if a farmer decides to grow a crop which can be used as feed for their animals they decrease the possible profit from that crop while also decreasing costs associated with that livestock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding data with which to model this problem is not difficult.  In fact, the challenge is actually in sifting through the abundance of government and industry reports in order to track down the various values.  As our goal was attempting to create an accurate model of this problem, continuing to add more detail to bring it closer and closer to reality, government sources were identified and values for costs and returns pulled from their tables [2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10].  If the focus of the work had been on searching for a true optimal set of choices and maximized return these data sources would have been further validated and the values normalized to ensure cross-compatibility (e.g dates, locations, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following section will describe the iterative process used to model this problem.  Starting with a simplied \"toy\" model and then adding complexity in order to bring the model closer to the real world problem.  The model description is followed by [Julia] code using [JuMP] (Julia for Mathematical Optimization) in order to encode the model and find optimal results.  These results are then thoroughly described, with the final model being compared to previous, simplied iterations.  Finally, conclusions about the problem, model and process are presented.\n",

    "Here, you should code up your model in Julia + JuMP and solve it. Your code should be clean, easy to read, well annotated and commented, and it should compile! You are not allowed to use other programming languages or DCP packages such as `convex.jl`. **I will be running your code**. I suggest having multiple code blocks separated by text blocks that explain the various parts of your solution. You may also solve several versions of your problem with different models/assumptions.\n",
